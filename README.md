# Avengers vs Invaders Coding Challenge

**Dataset:** https://github.com/liang-tao-se/avengers_vs_invaders

## Project Overview
This project is a coding challenge where Avengers heroes are assigned to different regions and tasked with fighting against invaders, including **Aliens**, **Predators**, and **Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) Monsters**. The goal is to manage the Avengers' roles (attack, defense, healing) across various regional headquarters (HQs) and provide a lookup system for their responsibilities.

## Features
- **Task 1: Lookup Table**  
  A table that allows users to find the email of an Avenger based on the country, invader species, and their role.
  
- **Task 2: Personal Info Tables**  
  A table for each Avenger showing their roles across different regions and invader types.

- **Optional Task 1: Markdown Tables**  
  All tables are converted into Markdown format for easy reading and sharing.

- **Optional Task 2: Interactive Dashboards**  
  Dashboards that allow users to filter and query Avenger data interactively.
